    "# Slater Determinants \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will discuss preparing Slater determinants as initial states following [[1]](#ref-1), [[2]](#ref-2) and [[3]](#ref-3) for use in first-quantized quantum simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of many quantum algorithms is the preparation of an initial state $|\\phi\\rangle$ that has a reasonable overlap with a desired eigenstate, $|\\psi\\rangle$, of a Hamiltonian $H$. For example, in phase estimation the output is an estimate of the eigenvalue with probability $|\\langle \\phi | \\psi\\rangle|^2$, and thus preparing states with good overlap is an important task. For fermionic systems a common initial state is the Hartree-Fock state, which is defined as that Slater Determinant which minimizes the total energy of the system. The Hartree-Fock algorithm yields a set of $N$ \"molecular orbitals\" (MOs) $\\{\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r})\\dots\\phi_N(\\mathbf{r})\\}$ and corresponding single-particle eigenvalues ${\\epsilon_{p}}$. A Slater-Determinant is then typically formed using the $\\eta$ lowest energy molecular orbitals as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Psi({\\mathbf{r}_1\\cdots\\mathbf{r}_\\eta}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}!}\\det \n",
    "    \\left(\n",
    "        \\begin{matrix}\n",
    "        \\phi_1(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{r}_1}) & \\dots & \\phi_\\eta(\\mathbf{r}_\\eta) \\\\\n",
    "        \\vdots & \\dots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "        \\phi_1(\\mathbf{\\mathbf{r}_\\eta}) & \\dots & \\phi_\\eta(\\mathbf{r}_\\eta) \\\\\n",
    "        \\end{matrix}\n",
    "    \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For example, if $\\eta=2$ we have $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r_1})\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r}_2) - \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r}_1))$. Slater determinants ensure that the many-electron state is antisymmetric under exchange of any pair of electrons $(\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) = - \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_2, \\mathbf{r}_1))$, which is necessary as electrons are fermions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally in chemistry and physics we write Slater determinants with the shorthand $|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\phi_1\\cdots\\phi_\\eta\\rangle$ and typically also work in second quantization. In second quantization we only need to know which single particle orbitals are occupied, and thus the Hartree-Fock state can be written as $|\\underbrace{1\\cdots 1}_{\\eta}\\underbrace{0\\cdots0}_{N-\\eta}\\rangle$, which signifies that the first $\\eta$ MOs are occupied. Fermion statistics are then encoded through the creation and annihilation operators which satisfy $\\{a_p^\\dagger, a_q\\} = \\delta_{pq}$. The ground state of our Hamiltonian $H$ can then be expanded as a linear combination of all possible Slater determinants which can be formed by occupying $\\eta$ electrons in $N$ spin-orbitals, of which there are $ N \\choose \\eta$ in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation of the Hartree-Fock state in second quantization is trivial if the Hamiltonian is represented in the MO basis, one just needs to set the first $\\eta$ qubits to on. However, for first quantized algorithms the task is more involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In first quantization, antisymmetrization has to be incorporated explicitly in our state, i.e., we form our Slater determinant through\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ represents a permutation of the electron labels and $\\pi(\\sigma)$ is the parity of the permutation. Assuming our labels are initially sorted then $\\pi(\\sigma) = 0$ for even permutations and $\\pi(\\sigma) = 1$ for an odd permutation. Also note the abuse of the ket notation to represent both product states $|\\phi_{\\sigma(i)}\\dots\\phi_{\\sigma(\\eta)}\\rangle$ and Slater determinants $|\\phi_1\\dots\\phi_\\eta\\rangle$. Note in some texts a distinction is drawn by writing product states as $|\\phi_1\\dots \\phi_\\eta)$, but we won't make that distinction here. It should be obvious from the context which we are referring to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above each $\\phi_p$ is associated with a basis function, and each orbital is represented using a register of size $\\log N$. It is also possible to use grid based approaches but we won't discuss that here.\n",
    "A convenient basis to use is a basis of $N$ planewaves:\n",

    "Following [[1]](#ref-1) we can generate the state in 4 steps assuming the state $|\\phi_i \\dots \\phi_\\eta\\rangle$ is available. Ref. [[3]](#ref-3) addresses how to prepare this initial product state in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare ancillary register `seed` in an even superposition of all length $\\eta$ strings of numbers $0,\\dots,f(\\eta)$ where $f(\\eta) \\ge \\eta^2$.  \n",
    "2. Sort `seed` using a reversible sorting network.\n",
    "3. Delete collisions, i.e., remove strings where orbitals are multiply occupied which are forbidden by Pauli exclusion principle.\n",
    "4. Apply reverse sort to `target` register.\n",
    "\n",
    "After step 4. we have an evenly weighted superposition of all possible permutations of the original labels. Controlled phase gates are applied after each swap to ensure the correct phase. This algorithm costs $\\mathcal{O} (\\eta \\log \\eta \\log N)$ $T$ gates. \n"
