        "The current optimal implementation of a reversible oracle for comparing two quantum numbers of $n$ qubits each is $8n + \\mathscr{O}(1)$ and is given in the supplementary materials of [Berry et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-018-0071-5). Their implementation uses divide and conquer technique to create a binary tree of depth $\\log{n}$ whose leafs are the qubits of then numbers with intermediate values stored in $\\mathscr{O}(n)$ ancillas. Each non leaf node uses two CSWAP operations and the value of the comparison is computed from the root node using one Toffoli. \n",
        "\n",
        "When this decomposition is applied to the case where one input is a list of qubits and the the other is a classical number (i.e. a string of bits) this decomposition gives a $6n + \\mathscr{O}(1)$ T complexity since at the level right above the leafs half of the CSWAP operations collapse to either identity or SWAP, thus the number of CSWAPs becomes $\\approx \\frac{n}{2} + 2 \\times \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{3n}{2}$, leadining to $4 \\times \\frac{3n}{2} = 6n$ T operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this paper we provide a different implementation with $4n + \\mathscr{O}(1)$ T operations count based on modeling the problem as a finite state machine of $2n$ states each having two transitions.\n"

The And operation itself can be done using only $4n + \\mathscr{O}(1)$ as per [Babbush et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1103%2Fphysrevx.8.041015) and [Craig Gidney](https://algassert.com/post/1903)."
