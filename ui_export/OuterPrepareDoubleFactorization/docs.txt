Outer state preparation.

Implements "the appropriate superposition state" on the $l$ register. i.e.

$$
|0\rangle = \sum_l a_l |l\rangle,
$$

where $a_l = \sqrt{\frac{c^{l}}{\sum_{l} c^{(l)}}$, and $c^{l} = \sum_{k} f_k^{(l)}^2$.

#### Parameters
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for double factorized Hamiltonian. Call L in Ref[1].
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called $\aleph$ in Ref[1].
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: Number of bits of precision for single qubit rotation for amplitude amplification in inner state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference. 

#### Registers
 - `l`: register to store L values for auxiliary index.
 - `succ_l`: flag for success of this state preparation.
