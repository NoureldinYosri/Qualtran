A SELECT bloq for selecting and applying operators from an array of `PauliString`s.

$$
\mathrm{SELECT} = \sum_{l}|l \rangle \langle l| \otimes U_l
$$

Where $U_l$ is a member of the Pauli group.

This bloq uses the unary iteration scheme to apply `select_unitaries[selection]` to `target`
controlled on the single-bit `control` register.

#### Parameters
 - `selection_bitsize`: The size of the indexing `select` register. This should be at least `log2(len(select_unitaries))`
 - `target_bitsize`: The size of the `target` register.
 - `select_unitaries`: List of `DensePauliString`s to apply to the `target` register. Each dense pauli string must contain `target_bitsize` terms.
 - `control_val`: Optional control value. If specified, a singly controlled gate is constructed.
