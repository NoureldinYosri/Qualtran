Inner prepare for THC block encoding.

Prepares the state in Eq. B11 of Ref [1].

Currently we only provide costs as listed in Ref[1] without their corresponding decompositions.

#### Parameters
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for single factorized Hamiltonian. Call L in Ref[1].
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called N.
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called aleph (fancy N) in Ref[1].
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: Number of bits of precision for rotations for amplitude amplification in uniform state preparation. Called b_r in Ref[1].
 - `kp1`: qroam blocking factor for data indexed by the first register. ($l$ in this case)
 - `kp2`: qroam blocking factor for data indexed by the second register. ($p, q$ in this case (these are made into a contiguous register.)) 

#### Registers
 - `l`: register to store L values for auxiliary index.
 - `p`: spatial orbital index. range(0, num_spin_orb // 2)
 - `q`: spatial orbital index. range(0, num_spin_orb // 2)
 - `succ_pq`: flag for success of this state preparation.
