An approximate QFT in which phase shifts smaller than a certain threshold are deleted.

Given a b-bit phase gradient state $|\phi\rangle$ prepared as

$$
    |\phi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{b}}} \sum_{k=0}^{2^{b} - 1} \omega_{b}^{-k} |k\rangle
$$

Phase gradient rotations can be synthesized via additions into the phase gradient register.
This leads to significant reductions in T/Toffoli complexity and requires 0 arbitrary
rotations (given a one-time cost to prepare the gradient register). See the linked reference
for more details.

The QFT uses exponentially small z-power gates. In practice, it is often sufficient to perform
an approximate qft, where z-power gates smaller than a certain threshold are dropped. When using
the "add into phase-gradient trick", this amounts to doing smaller additions with a smaller
phase gradient register.

#### Parameters
 - `bitsize`: Size of input register to apply QFT on.
 - `phase_bitsize`: The size of the phase gradient register. Defaults to being math.ceil(math.log2(bitsize)).
 - `with_reverse`: Whether or not to include the swaps at the end of the circuit decomposition that reverse the order of the qubits. If True, the swaps are inserted. Defaults to True. These are technically necessary in order to perform the correct effect, but can almost always be optimized away by just performing later operations on different qubits.
