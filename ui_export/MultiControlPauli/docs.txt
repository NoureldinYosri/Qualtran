Implements multi-control, single-target C^{n}P gate.

Implements $C^{n}P = (1 - |1^{n}><1^{n}|) I + |1^{n}><1^{n}| P^{n}$ using $n-1$
clean ancillas using a multi-controlled `AND` gate. Uses the Toffoli ladder
construction described in "n−2 Ancilla Bits" section of Ref[1] but uses an
$\text{AND} / \text{AND}^\dagger$ ladder instead for computing / uncomputing
using clean ancillas instead of the Toffoli ladder. The measurement based
uncomputation of $\text{AND}$ does not consume any magic states and thus has
better constant factors.
