Outer state preparation.

Implements Eq. B8 from the Reference.

#### Parameters
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for single factorized Hamiltonian. Called $L$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called $\aleph$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: Number of bits of precision for rotations for amplitude amplification in uniform state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference. 

#### Registers
 - `l`: register to store L values for auxiliary index.
 - `succ_l`: flag for success of this state preparation.
 - `l_ne_zero`: flag for preparation of one-body term too.
 - `rot_aa`: The qubit that is rotated for amplitude amplification.
