A controlled SELECT operation for single-qubit gates.

$$
\mathrm{SELECT} = \sum_{l}|l \rangle \langle l| \otimes [G(l)]_l
$$

Where $G$ is a function that maps an index to a single-qubit gate.

This gate uses the unary iteration scheme to apply `nth_gate(selection)` to the
`selection`-th qubit of `target` all controlled by the `control` register.

#### Parameters
 - `selection_regs`: Indexing `select` signature of type Tuple[`Register`, ...]. It also contains information about the iteration length of each selection register.
 - `nth_gate`: A function mapping the composite selection index to a single-qubit gate.
 - `control_regs`: Control signature for constructing a controlled version of the gate.
