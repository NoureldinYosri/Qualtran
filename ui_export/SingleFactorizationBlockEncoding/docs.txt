Block encoding of single factorization Hamiltonian.

Implements Fig. 15 in the reference.

#### Parameters
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called N.
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for single factorized Hamiltonian. Called $L$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called $\aleph$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa_outer`: Number of bits of precision for rotations for amplitude amplification in outer uniform state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa_inner`: Number of bits of precision for rotations for amplitude amplification in inner uniform state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference.
 - `kp1`: QROAM blocking factor for data prepared over l (auxiliary) index. Defaults to 1 (i.e. QROM).
 - `kp1`: QROAM blocking factor for data prepared over pq indicies. Defaults to 1 (i.e.) QROM.
 - `kp1_inv`: QROAM blocking factor for inverting the data prepared over l (auxiliary) index.
 - `kp1_inv`: QROAM blocking factor for inverting the data prepared over pq. 

#### Registers
 - `ctrl`: Control registers for state preparation.
 - `l`: register to store L values for auxiliary index.
 - `p`: spatial orbital index. range(0, num_spin_orb // 2)
 - `q`: spatial orbital index. range(0, num_spin_orb // 2)
 - `rot_aa`: Qubit to rotate for amplitude amplification for state preparation.
 - `swap_pq`: Qubit for controlling swaps over p and q registers.
 - `spin`: Qubit for controlling swaps over system registers.
 - `sys`: The system registers.
