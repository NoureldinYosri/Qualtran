Output data indexed by outer index $l$ needed for inner preparation.

We need to output $\Xi^{(l)}$ with $n_{\Xi}$ bits and the amplitude
amplification angles with $b_r$ bits for the inner state preparation. We
also output an offset with $n_{L\Xi}$ bits. The offset will be used to help
index a contiguous register formed from $l$ and $k$.

#### Parameters
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for double factorized Hamiltonian. Called L in Ref[1].
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called N.
 - `num_eig`: Total number of eigenvalues.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: Number of bits of precision for single qubit rotation for amplitude amplification.  Called $b_r$ in the reference. 

#### Registers
 - `l`: register to store L values for auxiliary index.
 - `l_ne_zero`: flag for one-body term.
 - `xi`: rank for each l
 - `rot`: rotation for amplitude amplification.
 - `offset`: offset for each DF factor.
