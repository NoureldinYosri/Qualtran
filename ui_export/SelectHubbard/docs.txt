The SELECT operation optimized for the 2D Hubbard model.

In contrast to SELECT for an arbitrary chemistry Hamiltonian, we:
 - explicitly consider the two dimensions of indices to permit optimization of the circuits.
 - dispense with the `theta` index for phases.

If neither $U$ nor $V$ is set we apply the kinetic terms of the Hamiltonian:

$$
-\hop{X} \quad p < q \\
-\hop{Y} \quad p > q
$$

If $U$ is set we know $(p,\alpha)=(q,\beta)$ and apply the single-body term: $-Z_{p,\alpha}$.
If $V$ is set we know $p=q, \alpha=0$, and $\beta=1$ and apply the spin term:
$Z_{p,\alpha}Z_{p,\beta}$

`SelectHubbard`'s construction uses $10 * N + log(N)$ T-gates.

#### Parameters
 - `x_dim`: the number of sites along the x axis.
 - `y_dim`: the number of sites along the y axis.
 - `control_val`: Optional bit specifying the control value for constructing a controlled version of this gate. Defaults to None, which means un-controlled. 

#### Registers
 - `control`: A control bit for the entire gate.
 - `U`: Whether we're applying the single-site part of the potential.
 - `V`: Whether we're applying the pairwise part of the potential.
 - `p_x`: First set of site indices, x component.
 - `p_y`: First set of site indices, y component.
 - `alpha`: First set of sites' spin indicator.
 - `q_x`: Second set of site indices, x component.
 - `q_y`: Second set of site indices, y component.
 - `beta`: Second set of sites' spin indicator.
 - `target`: The system register to apply the select operation.
