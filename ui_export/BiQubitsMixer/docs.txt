Implements the COMPARE2 subroutine from the reference (Fig. 1)

This gates mixes the values in a way that preserves the result of comparison.
The signature being compared are 2-qubit signature where

    x = 2*x_msb + x_lsb
    y = 2*y_msb + y_lsb

The Gate mixes the 4 qubits so that sign(x - y) = sign(x_lsb' - y_lsb') where x_lsb' and y_lsb'
are the final values of x_lsb' and y_lsb'.

Note that the ancilla qubits are used to reduce the T-count and the user
should clean the qubits at a later point in time with the adjoint gate.
