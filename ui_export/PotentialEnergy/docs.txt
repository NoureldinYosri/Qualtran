Bloq for a Coulombic Unitary.

This is a basic implementation which just iterates through num_elec *
(num_elec - 1) electron pairs.

#### Parameters
 - `num_elec`: The number of electrons.
 - `num_grid`: The number of grid points in each of the x, y and z directions. In total, for a cubic grid there are N = num_grid**3 grid points. The number of bits required (in each spatial dimension) is thus log N + 1, where the + 1 is for the sign bit.
 - `label`: A label for the bloqs short name. The potential bloq can encode any sort of Coulomb interaction (electron-electron, election-ion, ion-ion,...) so can be reused. This label is to distinguish these different cases. 

#### Registers
 - `system`: The system register of size eta * 3 * nb
