Initialize a state with $L$ unique coefficients using coherent alias sampling.

In particular, we take the zero state to:

$$
\sum_{\ell=0}^{L-1} \sqrt{p_\ell} |\ell\rangle |\mathrm{temp}_\ell\rangle
$$

where the probabilities $p_\ell$ are $\mu$-bit binary approximations to the true values and
where the temporary register must be treated with care, see the details in Section III.D. of
the reference.

The preparation is equivalent to [classical alias sampling]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method): we sample `l` with probability `p[l]` by first
selecting `l` uniformly at random and then returning it with probability `keep[l] / 2**mu`;
otherwise returning `alt[l]`.

Signature:
    selection: The input/output register $|\ell\rangle$ of size lg(L) where the desired
        coefficient state is prepared.
    temp: Work space comprised of sub signature:
        - sigma: A mu-sized register containing uniform probabilities for comparison against
            `keep`.
        - alt: A lg(L)-sized register of alternate indices
        - keep: a mu-sized register of probabilities of keeping the initially sampled index.
        - one bit for the result of the comparison.

This gate corresponds to the following operations:
 - UNIFORM_L on the selection register
 - H^mu on the sigma register
 - QROM addressed by the selection register into the alt and keep signature.
 - LessThanEqualGate comparing the keep and sigma signature.
 - Coherent swap between the selection register and alt register if the comparison
   returns True.

Total space will be (2 * log(L) + 2 mu + 1) work qubits + log(L) ancillas for QROM.
The 1 ancilla in work qubits is for the `LessThanEqualGate` followed by coherent swap.
