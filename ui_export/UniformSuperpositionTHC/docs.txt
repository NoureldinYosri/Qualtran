Prepare uniform superposition state for THC.

$$
    |0\rangle^{\otimes 2\log(M+1)} \rightarrow \sum_{\mu\le\nu}^{M} |\mu\rangle|\nu\rangle
    + \sum_{\mu}^{N/2}|\mu\rangle|\nu=M+1\rangle,
$$

where $M$ is the THC auxiliary dimension, and $N$ is the number of spin orbitals.

The toffoli complexity of this gate should be $10 \log(M+1) + 2 b_r - 9$.
Currently it is a good deal larger due to:
 1. inverting inequality tests should not need more toffolis.
 2. We are not using phase-gradient gate toffoli cost for Ry rotations.
 3. Small differences in quoted vs implemented comparator costs.
