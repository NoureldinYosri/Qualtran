Implements U s.t. U|l>|Psi> -> |l> T_{l} . Z_{l - 1} ... Z_{0} |Psi>

where T is a single qubit target gate that defaults to pauli Y. The gate is
implemented using an accumulator bit in the unary iteration circuit as explained
in the reference below.


#### Parameters
 - `selection_regs`: Indexing `select` signature of type `Register(dtype=BoundedQUInt)`. It also contains information about the iteration length of each selection register.
 - `control_regs`: Control signature for constructing a controlled version of the gate.
 - `target_gate`: Single qubit gate to be applied to the target qubits.
