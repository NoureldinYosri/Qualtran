Takes |x> to |x + k> for a classical integer `k`.

This construction simply XORs the classical constant into a quantum register and
applies quantum-quantum addition. This is the lowest T-count algorithm at the expense
of $n$ auxiliary qubits. This construction also permits an inexpensive controlled version:
you only need to control the loading of the classical constant which can be done with
only clifford operations.

#### Parameters
 - `bitsize`: Number of bits used to represent each integer.
 - `k`: The classical integer value to be added to x.
 - `cvs`: A tuple of control values. Each entry specifies whether that control line is a "positive" control (`cv[i]=1`) or a "negative" control (`cv[i]=0`).
 - `signed`: A boolean condition which controls whether the x register holds a value represented in 2's Complement or Unsigned. This affects the ability to add a negative constant. 

#### Registers
 - `x`: A bitsize-sized input register (register x above).
