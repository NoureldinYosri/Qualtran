Swap two registers controlled on a control bit.

Implements a multi-target controlled swap unitary $CSWAP_n = |0><0| I + |1><1| SWAP_n$.

This decomposes into a qubitwise SWAP on the two target registers, and takes $14n$ T-gates.

#### Parameters
 - `bitsize`: The bitsize of each of the two registers being swapped. 

#### Registers
 - `ctrl`: the control bit
 - `x`: the first register
 - `y`: the second register
