Array of controlled rotations $Z^{\theta_i/2}$ for a list of angles $\theta$.

It uses phase kickback and thus needs a phase gradient state in order to work. This
state must be provided externally for efficiency, as it is unaffected and can thus be reused.
Refer to [1], section on arbitrary quantum state preparation on page 3.

#### Parameters
 - `selection_bitsize`: number of qubits used for encoding the selection register of the QROM, it must be equal to $\lceil \log_2(l_{rv}) \rceil$, where $l_{rv}$ is the number of angles provided.
 - `phase_bitsize`: size of the register that is used to store the rotation angles. Bigger values increase the accuracy of the results.
 - `rom_values`: the tuple of values to be loaded in the rom, which correspond to the angle of each rotation.
 - `control_bitsize`: number of qubits of the control register. Set to zero for an uncontrolled gate.
