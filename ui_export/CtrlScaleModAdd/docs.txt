Perform y += x*k mod m for constant k, m and quantum x, y.

#### Parameters
 - `k`: The constant integer to scale `x` before adding into `y`.
 - `mod`: The modulus of the addition
 - `bitsize`: The size of the two registers. 

#### Registers
 - `ctrl`: The control bit
 - `x`: The 'source' quantum register containing the integer to be scaled and added to `y`.
 - `y`: The 'destination' quantum register to which the addition will apply.
