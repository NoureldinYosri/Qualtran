Block encoding of double factorization Hamiltonian.

Implements Fig. 15 in the reference.

#### Parameters
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called $N$.
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for double factorized Hamiltonian. Typically called $L$.
 - `num_eig`: The total number of eigenvalues.
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called $\aleph$ in Ref[1]. We assume this is the same for both outer and inner state preparations.
 - `num_bits_rot`: Number of bits of precision for rotations amplification in uniform state preparation. Called $\beth$ in Ref[1].
 - `num_bits_rot_aa_outer`: Number of bits of precision for single qubit rotation for amplitude amplification in outer state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference. Keeping inner and outer separate for consistency with openfermion.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa_inner`: Number of bits of precision for single qubit rotation for amplitude amplification in inner state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference. 

#### Registers
 - `ctrl`: Registers used to control application of Hamiltonian terms / preparation.
 - `l`: Register for outer state preparation.
 - `p`: Register for inner state preparation.
 - `rot_aa`: A qubit to be rotated for amplitude amplification.
 - `spin`: A single qubit register for spin superpositions.
 - `xi`: Register for rank parameter.
 - `offset`: Offset for p register.
 - `rot`: Amplitude amplification angles for inner preparations.
 - `rotations`: Rotations for basis rotations.
 - `sys`: The system register.
