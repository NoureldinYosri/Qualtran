Bloq implementing the hubbard U part of the hamiltonian using Hamming weight phasing.

Specifically:
$$
    U_I = e^{i t H_I}
$$
which can be implemented using equal angle single-qubit Z rotations.

Each interaction term can be implemented using a e^{iZZ} gate, which
decomposes into a single Rz gate flanked by cliffords. There are L^2
equal angle rotations in total all of which may be applied in parallel using HWP.

#### Parameters
 - `length`: Lattice length L.
 - `angle`: The rotation angle for unitary.
 - `hubb_u`: The hubbard U parameter.
 - `eps`: The precision for single qubit rotations. 

#### Registers
 - `system`: The system register of size 2 `length`.
