Bloq for rotating into THC basis through Givens rotation network.

This is accounting for In-data:rot and In-R in Fig. 7 of the THC paper (Ref.
1). In practice this bloq is made up of a QROM load of the angles followed
by controlled rotations. Equivalently it can be built from a modified
version of the ProgrammableRotationGateArray from implemented in qualtran
from Ref. 2. This is a placeholder waiting for an actual implementation.
See https://github.com/quantumlib/Qualtran/issues/386.

#### Parameters
 - `num_mu`: THC auxiliary index dimension $M$
 - `num_spin_orb`: number of spin orbitals $N$
 - `num_bits_theta`: Number of bits of precision for the rotations. Called $\beth$ in the reference.
 - `kr1`: block sizes for QROM erasure for outputting rotation angles. See Eq 34.
 - `kr2`: block sizes for QROM erasure for outputting rotation angles. This is for the second QROM (eq 35)
 - `two_body_only`: Whether to only apply the two body Hamiltonian. This reduces the QROM size.
 - `is_adjoint`: Whether to dagger this bloq or not.
