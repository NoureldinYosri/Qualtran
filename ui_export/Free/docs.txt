Free (i.e. de-allocate) a register.

The tensor decomposition assumes the register is uncomputed and is in the zero
state before getting freed. To verify that is the case, one can compute the resulting state
vector after freeing qubits and make sure it is normalized.

#### Parameters
 - `dtype`: The quantum data type of the register to be freed. 

#### Registers
 - `reg [left]`: The register to free.
