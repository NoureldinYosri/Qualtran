A controlled version of `subbloq`.

This meta-bloq is part of the 'controlled' protocol. As a default fallback,
we wrap any bloq without a custom controlled version in this meta-bloq.

Users should likely not use this class directly. Prefer using `bloq.controlled(ctrl_spec)`,
which may return a tailored Bloq that is controlled in the desired way.

#### Parameters
 - `subbloq`: The bloq we are controlling.
 - `ctrl_spec`: The specification for how to control the bloq.
