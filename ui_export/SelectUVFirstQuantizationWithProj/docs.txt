SELECT for the coulomb operators for the first quantized chemistry Hamiltonian.

Here we include a quantum projectile.

This does not include the controlled swaps from p_i and q_j system registers
into ancilla registers and back again. Hence there is no system register.

#### Parameters
 - `num_bits_p`: The number of bits to represent each dimension of the momentum register.
 - `num_bits_n`: The number of bits to represent each dimension of the momentum register for the projectile.
 - `eta`: The number of electrons.
 - `num_atoms`: The number of atoms.
 - `num_bits_nuc_pos`: The number of bits to store each component of the nuclear positions. $n_R$ in the reference.
