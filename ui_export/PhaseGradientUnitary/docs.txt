Implementation of (Controlled-/)PhaseGradient unitary gate on an n-bit register.

The class supports implementing the phase gradient unitary gate and a controlled version
thereof. The n bit phase gradient unitary is defined as

$$
    \text{PhaseGrad}_{n, t} = \sum_{k=0}^{2^{n}-1}|k\rangle \langle k| \omega_{n, t}^{k}
$$

where

$$
    \omega_{n, t} = \exp\left(\frac{2\pi i t}{2^n}\right)
$$

The implementation simply decomposes into $n$ (controlled-) rotations, one on each qubit.

#### Registers
 - `phase_grad`: A THRU register which the phase gradient is applied to.
