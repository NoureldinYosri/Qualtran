Applies U|x>|y>|z> = |x>|y> |z ^ (x <= y)>

Decomposes the gate in a T-complexity optimal way.

The construction can be broken in 4 parts:
 1. In case of differing bitsizes then a multicontrol And Gate
    (Section III.A. of the first reference) is used to check whether
    the extra prefix is equal to zero and the result is stored in the `prefix_equality` qubit.
 2. The tree structure (Fig. 2) of the second reference.
    followed by a `SingleQubitCompare` to compute the result of comparison of
    the suffixes of equal length. The result is stored in `less_than` and `greater_than` and
    equality in `qubits[-2]`
 3. The results from the previous two steps are combined to update the target qubit.
 4. The adjoint of the previous operations is added to restore the input qubits
    to their original state and clean the ancilla qubits.

When both registers are of the same size the T complexity is
8n - 4 as in the second reference.

When the registers differ in size and `n` is the size of the smaller one and
`d` is the difference in size, the T complexity is the sum of the tree
decomposition as before giving 8n + O(1); and the T complexity of an `And` gate
over `d` registers giving 4d + O(1). This totals 8n + 4d + O(1).
