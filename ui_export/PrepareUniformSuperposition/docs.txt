Prepares a uniform superposition over first $n$ basis states using $O(log(n))$ T-gates.

Performs a single round of amplitude amplification and prepares a uniform superposition over
the first $n$ basis states $|0>, |1>, ..., |n - 1>$. The expected T-complexity should be
$10 * log(L) + 2 * K$ T-gates and $2$ single qubit rotation gates, where $n = L * 2^K$.

However, the current T-complexity is $12 * log(L)$ T-gates and $2 + 2 * (K + log(L))$ rotations
because of two open issues:
 - https://github.com/quantumlib/Qualtran/issues/233 and
 - https://github.com/quantumlib/Qualtran/issues/235

#### Parameters
 - `n`: The gate prepares a uniform superposition over first $n$ basis states.
 - `cvs`: Control values for each control qubit. If specified, a controlled version of the gate is constructed.
