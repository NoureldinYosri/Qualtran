SELECT for the kinetic energy operator for the first quantized chemistry Hamiltonian.

#### Parameters
 - `num_bits_n`: The number of bits to represent each dimension of the momentum register.
 - `eta`: The number of electrons. 

#### Registers
 - `flag_T`: a flag to control on the success of the $T$ state preparation.
 - `flag_mean`: a flag for whether to select the mean part of the projectile's Hamiltonian or not.
 - `plus`: A $|+\rangle$ state.
 - `w`: A register for selecting x, y and z components of the momentum register.
 - `w_mean`: A register for selecting x, y and z components of the momentum register. This is for the mean part of the projectile's kinetic energy.
 - `r`: A register for controlling elements of the momentum register. Used for block encodiding kinetic energy operator.
 - `s`: A register for controlling elements of the momentum register. Used for block encodiding kinetic energy operator.
 - `p`: An ancilla register which should contained the (swapped) electron's state OR the projectiles state.
