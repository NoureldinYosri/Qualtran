LCU based block encoding using SELECT and PREPARE oracles.

Builds the standard block encoding from an LCU as
$$
    B[H] = \mathrm{PREPARE}^\dagger \cdot \mathrm{SELECT} \cdot \mathrm{PREPARE},
$$
where
$$
    \mathrm{PREPARE} |0\rangle_a = \sum_l \sqrt{\frac{w_l}{\alpha}} |l\rangle_a,
$$
and
$$
    \mathrm{SELECT} |l\rangle_a|\psi\rangle_s = |l\rangle_a U_l |\psi\rangle_s.
$$

The Hamiltonian can be extracted via

$$
    \langle G | B[H] | G \rangle = H / \alpha,
$$
where $|G\rangle_a = I_a |0\rangle_a$

The ancilla register is at least of size $\log L$.

In our implementations we typically split the ancilla registers into
selection registers (i.e.  the $l$ registers above) and junk registers which
are extra qubits needed by state preparation but not controlled upon during
SELECT.

#### Parameters
 - `alpha`: The normalization constant upper bounding the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian. Often called lambda.
 - `epsilon`: The precision to which the block encoding is performed. Currently this isn't used: see https://github.com/quantumlib/Qualtran/issues/985
 - `select`: The bloq implementing the `SelectOracle` interface.
 - `prepare`: The bloq implementing the `PrepareOracle` interface. 

#### Registers
 - `selection`: The combined selection register.
 - `junk`: Additional junk registers not prepared upon.
 - `system`: The combined system register.
