Applies U(add, M)|x> = |(x + add) % M> if x < M else |x>.

Applies modular addition to input register `|x>` given parameters `mod` and `add_val` s.t.
 1. If integer `x` < `mod`: output is `|(x + add) % M>`
 2. If integer `x` >= `mod`: output is `|x>`.

This condition is needed to ensure that the mapping of all input basis states (i.e. input
states |0>, |1>, ..., |2 ** bitsize - 1) to corresponding output states is bijective and thus
the gate is reversible.

Also supports controlled version of the gate by specifying a per qubit control value as a tuple
of integers passed as `cvs`.
