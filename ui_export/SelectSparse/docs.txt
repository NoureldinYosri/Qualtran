SELECT oracle for the sparse Hamiltonian.

Implements the two applications of Fig. 13.

#### Parameters
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called N.
 - `control_val`: The control value. If None, then the bloq is not controlled. 

#### Registers
 - `flag_1b`: a single qubit to flag whether the one-body Hamiltonian is to be applied or not during SELECT.
 - `swap_pq`: a |+> state to restore the symmetries of the p and q indices.
 - `swap_rs`: a |+> state to restore the symmetries of the r and s indices.
 - `swap_pqrs`: a |+> state to restore the symmetries of between (pq) and (rs).
 - `theta`: sign qubit.
 - `pqrs`: the register to store the spatial orbital index.
 - `alpha`: spin for (pq) indicies.
 - `beta`: spin for (rs) indicies.
