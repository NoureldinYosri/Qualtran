Perform a single phase estimation of ECAddR for a given point.

This is used as a subroutine in `FindECCPrivateKey`. First, we phase-estimate the
addition of the base point $P$, then of the public key $Q$.

#### Parameters
 - `n`: The bitsize of the elliptic curve points' x and y registers.
 - `point`: The elliptic curve point to phase estimate against.
