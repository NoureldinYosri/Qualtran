PREPARE for the kinetic energy operator for the first quantized chemistry Hamiltonian.

This prepares the state

$$
    |+\rangle\sum_{j=1}^{\eta}|j\rangle\sum_{w=0}^{2}|w\rangle
    \sum_{r=0}^{n_{p}-2}2^{r/2}|r\rangle
    \sum_{s=0}^{n_{p}-2}2^{s/2}|s\rangle
$$

The case assumes a quantum projectile whose state is descirbed by num_bits_n bits.

#### Parameters
 - `num_bits_p`: The number of bits to represent each dimension of the momentum register.
 - `num_bits_n`: The number of bits to represent each dimension of the momentum register for the projectile. This is called $n_n$ in the reference.
 - `eta`: The number of electrons.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: The number of bits of precision for the single qubit rotation for amplitude amplification. Called $b_r$ in the reference.
 - `is_adjoint`: whether to dagger the bloq or not. 

#### Registers
 - `w`: a register to index one of three components of the momenta.
 - `w_mean`: a register to index one of three components of the momenta for the projectile (used for the kmean part of the Hamiltonian)
 - `r`: a register encoding bits for each component of the momenta.
 - `s`: a register encoding bits for each component of the momenta.
