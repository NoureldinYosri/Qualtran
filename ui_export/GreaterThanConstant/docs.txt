Implements $U_a|x\rangle = U_a|x\rangle|z\rangle = |x\rangle |z \land (x > a)\rangle$

The bloq_counts and t_complexity are derived from equivalent qualtran gates
assuming a clean decomposition which should yield identical costs.

#### Parameters
 - `bitsize`: bitsize of x register.
 - `val`: integer to compare x against (a above.) 

#### Registers
 - `x`: Register to compare against val.
 - `target`: Register to hold result of comparison.
