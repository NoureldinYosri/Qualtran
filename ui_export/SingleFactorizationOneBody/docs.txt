Block encoding of single factorization one-body Hamiltonian.

Implements inner "half" of Fig. 15 in the reference. This block encoding is
applied twice (with a reflection around the inner state preparation
registers) to implement (roughly) the square of this one-body operator.

#### Parameters
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for single factorized Hamiltonian. Called $L$ in the reference.
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called $N$.
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called $\aleph$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: Number of bits of precision for rotations for amplitude amplification in uniform state preparation. Called $b_r$ in the reference.
 - `is_adjoint`: Whether this bloq is daggered or not. This affects the QROM cost.
 - `kp1`: QROAM blocking factor for data prepared over l (auxiliary) index. Defaults to 1 (i.e. QROM).
 - `kp1`: QROAM blocking factor for data prepared over pq indicies. Defaults to 1 (i.e.) QROM.
 - `kp1_inv`: QROAM blocking factor for inverting data prepared over l (auxiliary) index.
 - `kp1_inv`: QROAM blocking factor for inverting of data prepared over pq. 

#### Registers
 - `succ_l`: Flag for success of l state preparation.
 - `l_ne_zero`: Flag for l != 0.
 - `succ_pq`: Flag for success of pq.
 - `l`: register to store L values for auxiliary index.
 - `p`: spatial orbital index. range(0, num_spin_orb // 2)
 - `q`: spatial orbital index. range(0, num_spin_orb // 2)
 - `rot_aa`: Qubit to rotate for amplitude amplification for state preparation.
 - `swap_pq`: Qubit for controlling swaps over p and q registers.
 - `spin`: Qubit for controlling swaps over system registers.
 - `sys`: The system registers.
