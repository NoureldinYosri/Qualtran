A gate that rotates around the Z axis of the Bloch sphere.

The unitary matrix of `ZPowGate(exponent=t, global_shift=s)` is:
$$
    e^{i \pi s t}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & e^{i \pi t}
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

Note in particular that this gate has a global phase factor of
$e^{i\pi t/2}$ vs the traditionally defined rotation matrices
about the Pauli Z axis. See `Rz` for rotations without the global
phase. The global phase factor can be adjusted by using the `global_shift`
parameter when initializing.

#### Parameters
 - `exponent`: The t in gate**t. Determines how much the eigenvalues of the gate are phased by. For example, eigenvectors phased by -1 when `gate**1` is applied will gain a relative phase of e^{i pi exponent} when `gate**exponent` is applied (relative to eigenvectors unaffected by `gate**1`).
 - `global_shift`: Offsets the eigenvalues of the gate at exponent=1. In effect, this controls a global phase factor on the gate's unitary matrix. The factor for global_shift=s is:     exp(i * pi * s * t)
 - `eps`: precision for implementation of rotation. 

#### Registers
 - `qubits`: One-bit register.
