Prepares the uniform superposition over $|r\rangle$ given by Eq. 69 in the reference.

This prepares the state

$$
    2^{(-n_p -1)/2} \sum_r=0^{n_p-2} 2^{r/2} |r\rangle
$$

in one-hot unary.

To account for the conditional preparation of weight for the projectile we
add additional controls to the Hadamards for $p > n_p$.

#### Parameters
 - `bitsize_n`: the number of bits for the projectiles momentum $n_n$.
 - `bitsize_p`: the number of bits for the electron's momentum $n_p$ 

#### Registers
 - `r`: The register we want to prepare the state over.
