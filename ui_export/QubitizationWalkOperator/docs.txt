Construct a Szegedy Quantum Walk operator using LCU oracles SELECT and PREPARE.

For a Hamiltonian $H = \sum_l w_l H_l$ (where coefficients $w_l > 0$ and $H_l$ are unitaries),
This bloq constructs a Szegedy quantum walk operator $W = R_{L} \cdot \mathrm{SELECT}$,
which is a product of two reflections:
 - $R_L = (2|L\rangle\langle L| - I)$ and
 - $\mathrm{SELECT}=\sum_l |l\rangle\langle l|H_l$.

The action of $W$ partitions the Hilbert space into a direct sum of two-dimensional irreducible
vector spaces giving it the name "qubitization".
For an arbitrary eigenstate $|k\rangle$ of $H$ with eigenvalue $E_k$,
the two-dimensional space is spanned by $|L\rangle|k\rangle$ and
an orthogonal state $\phi_k$. In this space, $W$ implements a Pauli-Y rotation by an angle of
$-2\arccos(E_k / \lambda)$ where $\lambda = \sum_l w_l$. That is,
$W = e^{i \arccos(E_k / \lambda) Y}$.

Thus, the walk operator $W$ encodes the spectrum of $H$ as a function of eigenphases of $W$,
specifically $\mathrm{spectrum}(H) = \lambda \cos(\arg(\mathrm{spectrum}(W)))$
where $\arg(e^{i\phi}) = \phi$.

#### Parameters
 - `select`: The SELECT lcu gate implementing $\mathrm{SELECT}=\sum_{l}|l\rangle\langle l|H_{l}$.
 - `prepare`: Then PREPARE lcu gate implementing $\mathrm{PREPARE}|0\dots 0\rangle = \sum_l \sqrt{\frac{w_{l}}{\lambda}} |l\rangle = |L\rangle$
 - `control_val`: If 0/1, a controlled version of the walk operator is constructed. Defaults to None, in which case the resulting walk operator is not controlled.
