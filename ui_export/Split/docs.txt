Split a register of a given `dtype` into an array of `QBit`s.

A logical operation may be defined on e.g. a quantum integer, but to define its decomposition
we must operate on individual bits. `Split` can be used for this purpose. See `Join` for the
inverse operation.

#### Parameters
 - `dtype`: The quantum data type of the incoming data that will be split into an array of `QBit`s. 

#### Registers
 - `reg`: The register to be split. On its left, it is of the given data type. On the right, it is an array of `QBit()`s of shape `(dtype.num_qubits,)`.
