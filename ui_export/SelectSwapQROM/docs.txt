Gate to load data[l] in the target register when the selection register stores integer l.

Let
    N:= Number of data elements to load.
    b:= Bit-length of the target register in which data elements should be loaded.

The `SelectSwapQROM` is a hybrid of the following two existing primitives:

- Unary Iteration based `QROM` requires O(N) T-gates to load `N` data
elements into a b-bit target register. Note that the T-complexity is independent of `b`.
- `SwapWithZeroGate` can swap a `b` bit register indexed `x` with a `b`
bit register at index `0` using O(b) T-gates, if the selection register stores integer `x`.
Note that the swap complexity is independent of the iteration length `N`.

The `SelectSwapQROM` uses square root decomposition by combining the above two approaches to
further optimize the T-gate complexity of loading `N` data elements, each into a `b` bit
target register as follows:

- Divide the `N` data elements into batches of size `B` (a variable) and
load each batch simultaneously into `B` distinct target signature using the conventional
QROM. This has T-complexity `O(N / B)`.
- Use `SwapWithZeroGate` to swap the `i % B`'th target register in batch number `i / B`
to load `data[i]` in the 0'th target register. This has T-complexity `O(B * b)`.

This, the final T-complexity of `SelectSwapQROM` is `O(B * b + N / B)` T-gates; where `B` is
the block-size with an optimal value of `O(sqrt(N / b))`.

This improvement in T-complexity is achieved at the cost of using an additional `O(B * b)`
ancilla qubits, with a nice property that these additional ancillas can be `dirty`; i.e.
they don't need to start in the |0> state and thus can be borrowed from other parts of the
algorithm. The state of these dirty ancillas would be unaffected after the operation has
finished.
