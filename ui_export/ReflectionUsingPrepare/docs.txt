Applies reflection around a state prepared by `prepare_gate`

Applies $R_{s, g=1} = g (I - 2|s\rangle\langle s|)$ using $R_{s} =
P(I - 2|0\rangle\langle0|)P^{\dagger}$ s.t. $P|0\rangle = |s\rangle$.

Here:
- $|s\rangle$: The state along which we want to reflect.
- $P$: Unitary that prepares that state $|s\rangle $ from the zero state $|0\rangle$
- $R_{s}$: Reflection operator that adds a `-1` phase to all states in the subspace
    spanned by $|s\rangle$.
- $g$: The global phase to control the behavior of the reflection. For example:
    We often use $g=-1$ in literature to denote the reflection operator as
    $R_{s} = -1 (I - 2|s\rangle\langle s|) = 2|s\rangle\langle s| - I$

The composite gate corresponds to implementing the following circuit:

```
|control> ------------------ Z -------------------
                             |
|L>       ---- PREPARE^â€  --- o --- PREPARE -------
```


#### Parameters
 - `prepare_gate`: An implementation of `PREPARE` for state preparation.
 - `control_val`: If 0/1, a controlled version of the reflection operator is constructed. Defaults to None, in which case the resulting reflection operator is not controlled.
 - `global_phase`: The global phase to apply in front of the reflection operator. When building a controlled reflection operator, the global phase translates into a relative phase.
 - `eps`: precision for implementation of rotation. Only relevant if global_phase is arbitrary angle and gate is not controlled.
