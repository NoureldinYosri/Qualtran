Add two elliptic curve points.

This takes elliptic curve points given by (a, b) and (x, y)
and outputs the sum (x_r, y_r) in the second pair of registers.

#### Parameters
 - `n`: The bitsize of the two registers storing the elliptic curve point
 - `mod`: The modulus of the field in which we do the addition. 

#### Registers
 - `a`: The x component of the first input elliptic curve point of bitsize `n`.
 - `b`: The y component of the first input elliptic curve point of bitsize `n`.
 - `x`: The x component of the second input elliptic curve point of bitsize `n`, which will contain the x component of the resultant curve point.
 - `y`: The y component of the second input elliptic curve point of bitsize `n`, which will contain the y component of the resultant curve point.
 - `lam`: The precomputed lambda slope used in the addition operation.
