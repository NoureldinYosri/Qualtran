Inner prepare for DF block encoding.

Prepare state over $p$ register controlled on outer $l$ register.

#### Parameters
 - `num_aux`: Dimension of auxiliary index for double factorized Hamiltonian. Call L in Ref[1].
 - `num_spin_orb`: The number of spin orbitals. Typically called N.
 - `num_eig`: Total number of eigenvalues.
 - `num_bits_rot_aa`: Number of bits of precision for single qubit rotation for amplitude amplification. Called $b_r$ in the reference.
 - `num_bits_state_prep`: The number of bits of precision for coherent alias sampling. Called $\aleph$ in Ref[1]. 

#### Registers
 - `xi`: data register for number storing $\Xi^{(l)}$.
 - `rot`: qubit for amplitude amplification.
 - `succ_p`: control to flag success for inner state preparation.
 - `p`: Register for inner state preparation.
