Prepare the superposition over registers selecting between T U and V.

This will produce 3 qubits for flagging which term to apply. xx0 -> T, x0x -> U or V, 0xx -> V.

Note in reality this involves some state preparation and inequality testing.

#### Registers
 - `tuv`: a single qubit rotated to appropriately weight T and U or V.
 - `uv`: a single qubit rotated to appropriately weight U or V.
