The T gate.

This is the fourth root of the Pauli Z gate. Quantum programs composed solely
of gates belonging to the Clifford group (like X, Z, Hadamard, CNOT, S) can be simulated
efficiently by a classical computer and therefore offer no quantum advantage. The Clifford
gates do not provide a universal quantum gateset. The addition of any non-Clifford gate
makes the gateset universal. One of the most popular additions is the T gate, yielding
the common Clifford+T gateset.

The unitary matrix of `cirq.T` is
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    0 & e^{i \pi /4}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Parameters
 - `is_adjoint`: If True, this bloq is $T^\dagger$ instead. 

#### Registers
 - `q`: The qubit
