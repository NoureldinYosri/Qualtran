A bloq representing an arbitrary `n`-qubit clifford operation.

In the surface code architecture, clifford operations are generally considered
cheaper than non-clifford gates. Each clifford also has roughly the same cost independent
of what particular operation it is doing.

You can use this to bloq to represent an arbitrary clifford operation e.g. in bloq_counts
resource estimates where the details are unimportant for the resource estimation task
at hand.
