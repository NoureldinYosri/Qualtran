A 'black box' Select bloq.

The `SELECT` operation applies the $l$'th unitary $U_{l}$ on the system register
when the selection register stores integer $l$.
When implementing specific `SelectOracle` bloqs, it is helpful to have multiple selection
registers each with semantic meaning. For example: you could have spatial or spin coordinates
on different, named registers. The `SelectOracle` interface encourages this. `BlackBoxSelect`
uses the properties on the `SelectOracle` interface to provide a "black box" view of a select
operation that just has a selection and system register.
During decomposition, this bloq will use the `Partition` utility bloq to partition
and route the parts of the unified selection register to the `Select` bloq.

#### Parameters
 - `select`: The bloq implementing the `SelectOracle` interface. 

#### Registers
 - `selection`: The combined selection register
 - `system`: The combined system register
