The PREPARE operation optimized for the 2D Hubbard model.

In contrast to PREPARE for an arbitrary chemistry Hamiltonian, we:
 - explicitly consider the two dimensions of indices to permit optimization of the circuits.
 - dispense with the `theta` index for phases.

`PrepareHubbard` uses $O(\log(N))$ T gates and $O(1)$ single-qubit rotations.

#### Parameters
 - `x_dim`: the number of sites along the x axis.
 - `y_dim`: the number of sites along the y axis.
 - `t`: coefficient for hopping terms in the Hubbard model hamiltonian.
 - `u`: coefficient for single body Z term and two-body ZZ terms in the Hubbard model hamiltonian. 

#### Registers
 - `control`: A control bit for the entire gate.
 - `U`: Whether we're applying the single-site part of the potential.
 - `V`: Whether we're applying the pairwise part of the potential.
 - `p_x`: First set of site indices, x component.
 - `p_y`: First set of site indices, y component.
 - `alpha`: First set of sites' spin indicator.
 - `q_x`: Second set of site indices, x component.
 - `q_y`: Second set of site indices, y component.
 - `beta`: Second set of sites' spin indicator.
 - `target`: The system register to apply the select operation.
 - `junk`: Temporary Work space.
