Approximately implements a multi-target controlled swap unitary using only $4n$ T-gates.

Implements $\mathrm{CSWAP}_n = |0 \rangle\langle 0| I + |1 \rangle\langle 1| \mathrm{SWAP}_n$
such that the output state is correct up to a global phase factor of +1 / -1.

This is useful when the incorrect phase can be absorbed in a garbage state of an algorithm
and thus ignored. See the reference for more details.

#### Parameters
 - `bitsize`: The bitsize of the two registers being swapped. 

#### Registers
 - `ctrl`: the control bit
 - `x`: the first register
 - `y`: the second register
