# # Cubic Unit Cell First-Quantized Bloqs

# ## System Register
# The system Register is represented as signed integers for each Euler direction.
# for $\eta$ electrons we use $n_{p}$ bits for each of the $xyz$-directions which means the system register is $3 \eta n_{p}$ bits wide.  We will need additional ancilla registers for PREPARE and SELECT.
# We will be moving $i$ and $j$ electron registers into a working register which for $T$ $U$ and $V$ costs
# $12 \eta n_{p} + 4\eta - 8$. This comes from the core $12 \eta n_{p}$ plus 4 factors of $\eta - 2$ unary iteration.

# ## PREPARE Kinetic

# The kinetic energy PREPARE prepare's a state

# $|+\rangle\sum_{j=1}^{\eta}|j\rangle\sum_{w=0}^{2}|w\rangle\sum_{r=0}^{n_{p}-2}2^{r/2}|r\rangle \sum_{s=0}^{n_{p}-2}2^{s/2}|s\rangle$

# [1] The cost of preparing equal superposition over $\eta$ values of $i$ and $j$ is  $14 n_{\eta} + 8 b_{r} - 36$

# [2] State prep costs for $w$ $r$ and $s$ are $2 ( 2 n_{p} + 9)$

# ## SELECT Kinetic

# [1] Cost is $5(n_{p} - 1) + 2$ which comes from copying each $w$ component of $p$ into an ancilla register ($3(n_{p}-1)$), copying the $r$ and $s$ bit of into an ancilla ($2(n_{p}-1)$), controlling on both those bit perform phase flip on an ancilla $|+\rangle$ state. This requires $1$ Toffoli, Then erase which costs only Cliffords. There is an additional control bit controlling the application of $T$ thus we come to our total.


# ## PREPARE U + V

# [1] for $1/||\nu||$ preparation and inversion we have $3n_{p}^{2} + 15n_{p} âˆ’ 7 + 4n_{\mathcal{M}}(n_{p}+1)$

# [2] QROM for $R_{\ell}$ and for state prep with amplitudes $\sqrt{\lambda_{\ell}}$ we have cost $\lambda_{\zeta} + \mathrm{Er}(\lambda_{\zeta})$

# ## SELECT U + V

# [1] Addition and subtraction of $\nu$ costs $24 n_{p}$

# [2] phasing by the structure factor $-e^{i k_{\nu} \cdot R_{\ell}}$ costs $6 n_{p} n_{R}$


# ## REFLECTION Cost

# [1] $n_{\eta\zeta} + 2 n_{\eta} + 6 n_{p} + n_{\mathcal{M}} + 16$
