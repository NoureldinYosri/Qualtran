    "## `State preparation`\n",
    "\n",
    "PREPARE in THC requires state preparation to occur in two steps. In the first step we prepare a uniform superposition over a number of registers before we load the appropriate Hamiltonian coefficients which are defined over the registers we prepared in the first step. That is, if $H = \\sum_{pq}^N \\zeta_{pq} a^{\\dagger}_p a_q$ then we need at least two registers ($p$ and $q$) each of size $\\lceil \\log N \\rceil$ bits. The state we want to prepare is of the form $|\\psi\\rangle \\sim \\sum_{pq} \\sqrt{\\zeta_{pq}}|pq\\rangle$. This second step usually involves loading the parameters in QROM (or more commonly QRO(A)M) before performing alias sampling to prepare the appropriate superposition state. At a high level step one usually has a logarithmic cost in the size of the registers, while step 2 has a cost that goes like $\\sqrt{d}$ where $d$ is the amount of data to load and arises from the QROM circuit (in the above example $d = N^2$). As step 2 is typically **the** dominant cost in the second quantized algorithms, a lot of effort is placed on loading the **minimum** amount of data required to specify the Hamiltonian. In particular, the quantum chemistry Hamiltonian exhibits several symmetries which can be exploited to reduce the QROM cost by several factors of two.\n",

    "which demonstrates the main ideas. Above we are essentially assuming our matrix $\\zeta$ is symmetric so that we only need to load $d = M (M+1)/2$ data rather than $M^2$ which is a modest, but useful improvement.\n",
    "We will also assume for the moment that the matrix has all positive matrix elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 is to prepare a uniform superposition over our registers. We will use a single round of amplitude amplification to boost our success probability to close to 1. Our circuit is a simplified version of that given in Fig. 3 of [Ref 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03494.pdf). Here it is: "

    "1. Prepare a uniform superposition over the $p$ and $q$ registers with Hadamards with zero Toffoli cost.\n",
    "2. We rotate an ancilla qubit by \"adding a constant into a phase gradient register\". There are a few things to unpack here:\n",
    "    * The constant (i.e. angle) is given by $0.436 \\pi = \\arccos(1-8/10)$, where $8=2^{4-1}$ and $10 = 4 \\times (4 + 1) / 2$. That is, (one minus) the ratio of the number of bits used needed to prepare our state and the amount of data we are going to prepare. The choice of this angle is described in more detail in the [amplitude amplification tutorial]().\n",
    "    * The phase gradient register is a relatively cheap way to implement single qubit rotations fault tolerantly. For the moment let us just note that for us we need a single qubit $R_y$ gate and it costs b_r - 3 Toffolis, where $b_r=7$ is the number of bits used to represent the angle and this has found to be sufficient. See [techniques for single qubit rotations]() for further discussion on fault tolerant implementations of single qubit rotations.\n",
    "3. Next we perform an inequality test on the $p$ and $q$ registers, and write the result of $p\\le q$ into another ancilla register. This has cost n_p - 1 Toffolis where $n_p$ is the number of bits required to represent the range of $p$ values.\n",
    "4. We use a Toffoli gate to control off of the result of the inequality test and the $Ry$ rotation. If both these succeed then we set the third ancilla to on and phase this ancilla with a $Z$ gate. We then undo the Toffoli. This step has a cost of 2 Toffoli gates and 1 Clifford operation.\n",
